        <h2>Thoughts on Cryptology</h2>
        <p>Helena Maudoux / July 21, 2021</p>
        <p>
            I think the world today and myself have been impacted 
            by cryptography as if Elizabeth Friedman had not cracked 
            the Nazis code, we would perhaps not be the same country 
            or world we are today. Cryptography has both positive and 
            negative aspects. On one hand you are able to use it to 
            send encrypted messages to certain people. It keeps 
            confidentiality, authenticity, and data integrity. 
            Elizabeth Friedman decrypted a Nazi message which helped 
            the FBI in the long run. An example of using cryptology in 
            the world is cash withdrawal from an ATM.
