        <h2>Thoughts on Cryptology</h2>

            The video below is a tutorial on how to create bold and 
            italic elements in HTML. This video is really helpful, 
            as it provides simple instructions that afre easy to 
            understand. It enables the watcher to succesfully learning
            how to make their text bold or italicized.

            I think the world today and myself have been impacted 
            by cryptography as if Elizabeth Friedman had not cracked 
            the Nazis code, we would perhaps not be the same country 
            or world we are today. Cryptography has both positive and 
            negative aspects. On one hand you are able to use it to 
            send encrypted messages to certain people. It keeps 
            confidentiality, authenticity, and data integrity. 
            Elizabeth Friedman decrypted a Nazi message which helped 
            the FBI in the long run. An example of using cryptology in 
            the world is cash withdrawal from an ATM.

            I have encountered Machine Learning in the past when an ad 
            pops up which suggests something I enjoy. I enjoy jewelry, 
            so I often see jewelry ads on various websites. Another 
            example of Machine learning is various apps like Youtube, 
            Spotify, and others. They base the recommendations on what 
            you have previously watched or listened to. I  think these 
            recommendations are fair as they provide me with similar 
            content to my liking. However, it can also be unfair as I 
            may not be able to discover new things, as it will only 
            recommend the things it knows I like. 
        </p>  
        <p>
            I think the unfairness can be addressed by programming the 
            machine learning algorithm to not only take in what people 
            like and give them similar things to it but also give them 
            a variety so they are able to experience other things. An
            example of this could be offering more variety of Youtube 
            videos while still keeping those that the person enjoys.

            In class, my group and I were unsure of what 
            to pick as an issue so we chose to put whether or not the person 
            in the webcam had a stuffed Otto, in order to tell whether they 
            have gone to Syracuse or attended one of their programs.

            My team and I were asked to create a game that would help teachers 
            and other adults to be better at gender identity. We were provided 
            an inspo game which was Among Us, which we used as a reference. We 
            named our company Otto Gaming and named our game Genders Among Us 
            (Identity Expedition). Our main goal for the game was to help 
            teachers memorize the different pronouns and terms to a certain 
            person. We also hoped to increase adults' knowledge on gender 
            identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the game we added a few features to help make it similar to Among 
            Us. We added multiplayer, we had randomly assigned avatars, names, 
            and pronouns, a classroom-themed setting, and some memory-based 
            minigames (tasks). We wanted the avatars to acclimatize teachers to 
            different combinations of appearances/names/pronouns.

            The map in which the game takes place is in a school, where one room 
            can be the Math classroom, the dining hall, computer lab etc. The 
            purpose of this is to make the game resonate with the students and 
            teachers by giving them a familiar environment. For the minigames we 
            would have one where the person would need to match the person's 
            appearance to their name/pronoun. Another one would be where the 
            player receives a gender identity term in one area of the map and 
            then proceeds to go to another part of the map to identify the 
            pronouns, in order to complete the task. Together we came up with an 
            amazing game idea which would benefit the teachers and helped us to 
            get more familiar with game creation.
