        <h2>Thoughts on Cryptology</h2>
        <p>Helena Maudoux / July 21, 2021</p>

            I think the world today and myself have been impacted 
            by cryptography as if Elizabeth Friedman had not cracked 
            the Nazis code, we would perhaps not be the same country 
            or world we are today. Cryptography has both positive and 
            negative aspects. On one hand you are able to use it to 
            send encrypted messages to certain people. It keeps 
            confidentiality, authenticity, and data integrity. 
            Elizabeth Friedman decrypted a Nazi message which helped 
            the FBI in the long run. An example of using cryptology in 
            the world is cash withdrawal from an ATM.

            I have encountered Machine Learning in the past when an ad 
            pops up which suggests something I enjoy. I enjoy jewelry, 
            so I often see jewelry ads on various websites. Another 
            example of Machine learning is various apps like Youtube, 
            Spotify, and others. They base the recommendations on what 
            you have previously watched or listened to. I  think these 
            recommendations are fair as they provide me with similar 
            content to my liking. However, it can also be unfair as I 
            may not be able to discover new things, as it will only 
            recommend the things it knows I like. 
        </p>  
        <p>
            I think the unfairness can be addressed by programming the 
            machine learning algorithm to not only take in what people 
            like and give them similar things to it but also give them 
            a variety so they are able to experience other things. An
            example of this could be offering more variety of Youtube 
            videos while still keeping those that the person enjoys.

            In class, my group and I were unsure of what 
            to pick as an issue so we chose to put whether or not the person 
            in the webcam had a stuffed Otto, in order to tell whether they 
            have gone to Syracuse or attended one of their programs.
