        <h1>Helena Maudoux's Biography</h1>
        <p>
        My name is Helena. I am a rising senior, and I am located in California.
        </p>
        I decided to take this class to expand my knowledge of technology and see 
        a preview of how college may be like. I also wanted to see a preview of how 
        college life was like. Additionally, I think that incuding not only classes 
        and homework but aso virtual activities is amazing.
        <p>
        I am specificaly interested in how things are made, what items, software is 
        needed. I hope to learn more about coding and people's various experiences 
        and stories to grow as a person, anf grow my knowledge.
        </p>
