        My name is Helena. I am a rising senior, and I am located in California. I decided to take this class to expand my knowledge of technology and see a preview of how college may be like. I am specificaly interested in how things are made, what items, software is needed. Outside of school I like art, reading, animals, traveling, and going out with friends. I can speak French fluently, and I own a cat.
